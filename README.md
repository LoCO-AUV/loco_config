# LoCO
Meta-repository containing the current stable version of packages for the LoCO autonomous robot.

Please note that as you can find in the License information, this is an open-source project, with code released under the __GPLv3__ license (please see LICENSE_GPLV3) and design released under the __Creative Commons ShareALike License__ (Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International -- see LICENSE_SHAREALIKE). As such, we plan to release our updates and improvements to LoCO over time, we would like to see people submitting their own improvements and additions, and we hope to be helpful to people looking for help. However, we will not provide commercial-level support for LoCO. Due to the nature of the project, we cannot guarantee help or support for anyone who chooses to build their own LoCO, though we hope to create a mutually helpful and productive community around the robot. Thank you for your understanding.

If any of the code, design, documentation, or the entire platform comes in handy for your research or education, we would appreciate a shoutout, and even better, a citation to the following paper(s).
